/* psyq/libcd.c: LIBCD over a sector source (runtime/disc.c: the user's BIN). The command model is the PS1's
 * as far as the game's callback chains need it (cdload.c: CdControlF(Setloc) -> sync CdlComplete ->
 * CdControlF(Setmode) -> sync -> CdControlF(ReadN) -> sync, then one CdlDataReady per sector to the ready handler,
 * CdControlF(Pause) -> sync), and the movie stream (CdRead2 and St*) is LIBCD's ring of whole frames.
 *
 * Time is counted in vsync ticks only (psyq_cd_tick, run by the port's pump once per vsync; never the wall clock):
 *  - CdControl/CdControlB (blocking) apply the command at once and return 1; no callback runs for them.
 *  - CdControlF (asynchronous) records the command; the next tick applies it and runs the CdSyncCallback handler
 *    with CdlComplete. A command issued from a handler waits for the following tick.
 *  - A read (ReadN/ReadS) delivers sectors from the sector source, each with its own CdlDataReady call to the
 *    CdReadyCallback handler, the new sector in CdGetSector's window. The tick stops delivering as soon as a handler
 *    issues a command (cdload's Pause after its last sector): the command completes on the next tick, before any
 *    later sector, and a Pause ends the read. A sector the source does not have ends the read with CdlDataEnd
 *    (without a source, at once: the game retries forever).
 *  - Timing "realistic" (the default; psyq_cd_set_timing): the drive's rate from the Setmode byte (bit 0x80 double
 *    speed: 150 sectors/s = 3 per tick at 50 Hz; else 75/s = 1.5 per tick, delivered as 1, 2, 1, 2, ...), starting
 *    the tick after the read's acknowledgement, plus a seek before the first sector when the read follows a Setloc:
 *    PSYQ_CD_SEEK_BASE ticks + one per PSYQ_CD_SEEK_SPAN sectors between the head and the target, at most
 *    PSYQ_CD_SEEK_MAX (60 ms for a short seek up to 800 ms across the whole disc). Real drives (psx-spx "CDROM
 *    Drive"): a Setloc + read first moves the sled and waits for the target sector's address to come by, a few
 *    tens of ms nearby up to about a second over the whole disc, with no fixed formula; this model is a
 *    deterministic stand-in, not a measurement. A read with no Setloc since the last one continues at the head.
 *  - Timing "instant": no seek; sectors start in the same tick as the acknowledgement, up to
 *    PSYQ_CD_INSTANT_SECTORS per tick (as many as the game takes before it pauses or issues a command).
 *
 * The stream (stdwtitl_80082D70.c's player: StSetRing(ring, 32 sectors), StSetStream, CdControl Setloc/Setmode,
 * CdRead2(0x1E0), then StGetNext/StFreeRing per frame, CdControlB(Pause) + StUnSetRing at the end) reads from the
 * Setloc position at the drive's rate. Video sectors (Form 1 data whose first word is the StHEADER magic 0x80010160:
 * id 0x0160, type 0x8001; then secCount, nSectors, frameCount, frameSize, width, height, ...; 32 bytes of header and
 * 2016 bytes of MDEC data per sector, as psx-spx "CDROM File Video Contents" and MOVIE*.STR's sectors have them)
 * are assembled into whole frames; XA audio sectors go to the XA decoder (below), other sectors are skipped. A frame
 * lives in the game's own ring buffer (StSetRing's address and size: 32 sectors = 64 KB here) as one contiguous slot:
 * the first sector's 32-byte StHEADER, then the nSectors * 2016 data bytes in secCount order. StGetNext hands out
 * the oldest complete frame (*addr = its data, *header = its StHEADER), StFreeRing(addr) releases it. This layout is
 * ours (LIBCD's own placement of headers and data in the ring is not documented publicly); it keeps every pointer
 * the game sees inside game memory (the arena) and the data contiguous, which is what DecDCTvlc2 needs.
 * When the ring has no room for a new frame: "realistic" drops the frame's sectors (the drive keeps reading at its
 * rate: a consumer too slow loses frames, as LIBCD's ring overflows; to verify), "instant" waits (the sector is
 * read again on a later tick).
 *
 * StGetNext is polled without a wait hook (stdwtitl_get_next_frame: up to 2000 x 2000 polls); on the PS1 the CD and
 * vsync interrupts keep running while it spins. Here every PSYQ_ST_POLLS_PER_VSYNC consecutive empty polls run one
 * vsync tick (psyq_vsync_tick: the game's VSyncCallback handler, the pump's frame work and the CD tick), so the
 * movie plays at the drive's rate, not at the host's. The constant is an estimate (a PAL vsync is 677,376 CPU
 * cycles at 33.8688 MHz; a poll of the loop is taken as ~135 cycles), not a measurement.
 *
 * XA audio (M5; docs/SOUND.md "CD audio"), as psx-spx "Data/ADPCM Sector Filtering/Delivery" has it: with the Setmode
 * byte's bit 0x40 (XA-ADPCM; the movies' CdRead2(0x1E0)), a Mode 2 sector whose submode has audio and real time (0x44)
 * goes to the drive's XA decoder instead of the CPU, in a read (no CdlDataReady for it) as in the stream; with bit
 * 0x08 (XA-Filter) only one whose file and channel match CdlSetfilter's, the others being dropped. The game sets no
 * filter: the movies have one audio channel (file 1, channel 1, coding 01h: stereo, 37,800 Hz, 4 bits) in every
 * eighth sector, at double speed 18.75 sectors/s = 37,800 frames/s. psyq/xa.c decodes a sector and resamples it
 * to 44,100 Hz (2016 frames -> 2352) into this file's FIFO, in the CD tick that delivers the sector. The FIFO feeds
 * the SPU's CD input (spu_cd_input) at the end of every CD tick with PSYQ_XA_PER_TICK = 882 frames: what the next
 * vsync's render consumes at 50 Hz (audio.c renders in the vsync pre-hook, before the tick). The sectors arrive in
 * whole ticks (3 per tick: an audio one after 2, 3, 3 ticks), so a decoder that started playing at once would run dry
 * 294 frames before the next audio sector, where the hardware, whose sectors arrive continuously, has no gap. A run's
 * first sector therefore waits one tick (20 ms of latency) before its samples go out; the FIFO then never runs dry
 * while the drive streams (its low point is 588 frames). When it does run dry (the stream ended, or the reads fell
 * behind), the run ends and the next audio sector starts a new one with its wait. Beyond PSYQ_XA_FIFO frames (instant
 * timing reads ahead) the newest are dropped, counted in the trace. A Pause, a new read, StUnSetRing, CdInit and the
 * reset flush the FIFO and reset the decoder (ADPCM history, resampler ring: psx-spx does not say when the hardware
 * clears them; a movie starts from silence here); at most one tick's frames, already in the SPU's queue, still play.
 * The drive's own volume matrix (ATV0..3, LIBCD's CdMix) stays at its power-on 80h = unity, left to left and right to
 * right (the game never sets it); the SPU applies the CD volume (1B0h/1B2h) and SPUCNT bit 0, which CdInit sets.
 * The drive's rate is per second: psyq_cd_set_vsync_hz (the nominal rate, runtime/pump.c port_rate: 50, or 60 with
 * the 60 Hz setting) turns it into sectors and XA frames per tick (2.5 sectors and 735 frames at 60), and the seeks keep
 * their milliseconds. A --fps other than the nominal rate changes neither: the SPU's queue then fills (and drops) or
 * runs dry.
 *
 * Assumptions to verify (against the emulator where it matters):
 *  - a blocking CdControl never calls the sync handler (the game registers it only around CdControlF reads);
 *  - CdlReadN acknowledges with CdlComplete before its first sector (cdload's state machine needs that order);
 *  - the sector window per mode byte: CdlModeSize1 (0x20) = 2340 bytes from the 4-byte header on (what cdload
 *    uses: mode 0xA0, docs/FORMATS.md), CdlModeSize0 (0x10) = 2328 bytes = data + EDC/ECC, else the 2048 data
 *    bytes; the result buffer's first byte is the status (0x02: motor on);
 *  - StSetStream's callbacks (func1/func2; the game passes none) are not called; frames outside
 *    [start_frame, end_frame] are skipped. */
