# The PC port runtime

How a decompiled PS1 game runs as a native program on psxstack: the architecture, the PS1 assumptions the runtime
handles, and what it does not do. Building a game with it is `cmake/psxstack.cmake` (`psxstack_add_game()`;
GAME_CONTRACT.md "5. The build inputs"); the command-line options, the per-frame log and the record formats are in
`docs/RUNTIME.md`; the shim's per-function behaviour in `psyq/README.md`; the launcher and the settings file in
`docs/LAUNCHER.md`. The first game's own port documentation (its hooks, its adapter, its tests) is dw2003recomp's
`docs/PORT.md`. The choices behind this design are in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Overview
- A game's C is compiled for the host with `-DPC_PORT` (and the game's own defines) and linked with the runtime
  (`runtime/`), the game's adapter and our own Psy-Q shim (`psyq/`) into one 64-bit executable named after the game.
- No emulator is linked and no Sony code is used: the game code runs natively, and the PS1 hardware the game reaches
  through Sony's libraries (GPU, GTE, SPU, MDEC, CD drive, pads, memory cards) is reimplemented in C behind the shim.
  Emulators serve only as external test oracles.
- The game's PS1 matching build is untouched: every port change in its C is either a hook macro from its own
  `port.h` that expands to the original code without `PC_PORT`, or an `#ifdef PC_PORT` block (GAME_CONTRACT.md "3").
- The default build is headless (what the tests run); `-DPSXSTACK_SDL=ON` adds the SDL3 window, input and audio device.
- The game reads the user's own disc image (BIN/CUE, SHA-1 checked against the game's description); the stack holds
  no game data and no game code.

## Source layout
| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `include/psxstack/hooks.h` | The host side of the hook macros and the `port_*` interface the game's C calls; the game's `port.h` includes it under `PC_PORT` (GAME_CONTRACT.md "2") |
| `include/psxstack/game.h`, `mods.h` | The adapter interface the game implements (`game_main`, `game_apply_rate`, the `game_state_*` probes, `game_mods`) and a mod's shape; `runtime/game_defaults.c` has a weak default for each |
| `include/psxstack/types.h` | The PS1-style type names for the stack's own C (the game's `common.h` defines the same under the same guard) |
| `include/psxstack/port_runtime.h`, `port_harness.h`, `settings.h`, `spu.h`, `platform.h`, `json.h`, `sha1.h` | The runtime's internal interfaces |
| `runtime/` | The runtime: `main.c` (options, setup), `arena.c`, `overlay.c`, `pump.c`, `reset.c`, `disc.c`, `memcard.c`, `video.c`, `render_gpu.c`, `input.c`, `audio.c` and `spu*.c`, `script.c`, `framelog.c`, `settings.c`, `mods.c` (the engine and the fast_forward mod), `crash.c`, `debug.c`, `platform.c`, `json.c`, `sha1.c` |
| `psyq/` | The Psy-Q shim: one file per library, plus the hardware models `gpu.c`, `gte.c`, `mdec.c`, `xa.c`; `check.sh` compiles it alone and checks its coverage of a game |
| `shaders/` | The hardware renderer's HLSL, compiled to SPIR-V (and for Windows to DXIL) by DXC at build time and embedded (`cmake/embed.cmake`) |
| `mods/fast_forward/` | The one mod every game has (its manifest; the code is in `runtime/mods.c`) |
| `cmake/psxstack.cmake` | `psxstack_add_game()`: the whole build (below, "What the build generates") |
| `tools/game_gen.py` | The game description (`game.json`) to `psxstack_game_gen.h` and CMake variables |
| `tools/port_gen.py` | The generators the build runs: the override headers, the units' compile launcher (the overlay sections), the overlay address tables, the state tables, the post-link check |
| `tools/port_inventory.py` | The host-compile gate (`probe`, `link`) and the inventory of what a game's C needs (`counts`); a game configures it |
| `tools/mcp/` | The MCP server over the debug channel, the client, the symbols (configured by the game's `.mcp.json`) |
| `examples/hello/` | A disc-free Psy-Q program built through `psxstack_add_game()`: the stack's smoke test |

## Compiling the game C for the host
- **Flags:** C99 with GNU extensions (`gnu99`: unprototyped `f()` declarations are common in the game C and C23 would
  read them as `(void)`), `-fsigned-char` (the code relies on signed `char`), `-fwrapv`, `-fno-strict-aliasing`.
  On ELF `-fno-pie`/`-no-pie`, for the debug channel alone: it, the MCP server and a game's tests over them resolve host
  symbols with `nm`'s link-time addresses of the binary, which a PIE would relocate at load (Ubuntu's GCC
  links PIE by default). Nothing else needs it: the arena needs no link address (see "Memory arena") and the
  overlay sections are orphan sections the linker places after `.data`/`.bss`, outside GNU_RELRO (see "Overlays").
- **`INCLUDE_ASM`** is empty on the host (the generated `include_asm.h`): a function a game still keeps in asm is
  absent from the port, and a call to it is an unresolved symbol at link time, unless the game provides a stand-in.
- **`gte_*` macros** (the game's `gtemac.h`, MIPS `cop2` sequences; `GTEMAC` in `psxstack_add_game()`) are replaced at build time by a generated header
  that turns each sequence into the same register accesses on the software GTE (`tools/port_gen.py overrides`;
  see "GTE").
- **The host-compile gate:** `tools/port_inventory.py probe` (configured by the game's own wrapper) compiles every
  unit at `-m64` with `-Werror` on pointer/integer casts, `int-conversion`, implicit declarations and incompatible
  pointer types; `link` checks the objects for duplicate globals. A game's remaining host warnings (missing returns,
  `-Wmissing-braces`, ...) are in its matching C and left as they are.
- **Undefined behaviour the PS1 tolerated** is fixed in the C under `PC_PORT` or in a form that keeps the PS1 bytes,
  as the sanitizer runs find it (the first game's `tests/host/FINDINGS.md` lists its cases: for example a `% 0`,
  which does not trap on the R3000A but raises SIGFPE on x86). In-struct overruns a game relies on go in its UBSan
  suppressions and nowhere else.

## Hook macros (`include/psxstack/hooks.h`)
A game's `common.h` includes its `port.h`; no unit includes it directly. Each macro is the original code without
`PC_PORT`, in the game's header; with it, `port.h` includes `include/psxstack/hooks.h`, where the host side lives (the
PS1 build never needs that path). `tier` is a slot's 1-based index in the game description's `memory.slots`:

| Macro | The game's use | Host meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PLATFORM_WAIT()` | The body of a busy-wait that only an interrupt can end | `port_wait()`: runs the pending vsync/CD/GPU "interrupts" |
| `PLATFORM_HALT()` | A deliberate endless loop | `port_halt()`: reports the place and exits |
| `PORT_SCRATCHPAD_STACK_ENTER/LEAVE` | A switch to a stack in the scratchpad (raw `$sp` asm) | Nothing: the normal stack |
| `OVERLAY_COPY(tier, file, dst, src, size)` | An overlay `memcpy` into a slot | `port_overlay_load()` (see "Overlays") |
| `SLOT_FUNC(type, addr)` | A function at a fixed address in a slot (the game wraps it in its own typed macros) | A *tag*: the PS1 address kept as an integer in a function pointer (valid in static initializers) |
| `OVERLAY_FN(tier, fn)` | A call through a pointer that may hold a tag | `port_overlay_resolve()`: a tag becomes the current overlay's host function; a real pointer passes unchanged |
| `LATE_FUNC` / `LATE_CALL` | A call by name into whatever overlay is loaded | Resolved by address through the current overlay's table |
| `SLOT_PTR(tier, type, addr)` | Data in a slot | The same offset into the arena's slot buffer |
| `HEAP_START/END/SIZE_FROM/ADDR` | The heap's bounds and constants inside it | The arena's heap region |
| `PTR_ADD(type, ofs, base)` | An offset-table resolve, written on the PS1 as `ofs + (s32)base` | Pointer arithmetic |
| `PTR_TO_S32` / `S32_TO_PTR` | A pointer kept in an `s32` field or argument | The pointer's PS1-style address in the arena, and back (fatal outside the arena) |
| `PTR_TO_U32(p)` | The 24-bit ordering-table tags (`setaddr`) | The pointer's word offset in the tag window (the game's data and the arena; fatal outside it) |
| `BIOS_PTR(type, addr)` | A read of the BIOS ROM | A stand-in region holding the description's `bios_standin` texts (`arena.c`) |

`port_file_wait_read(id)` is the one function hook: a game that frees a file the CD is still reading into calls it
and then waits for the read. A game's own hooks (its typed slot-function macros, its mods' flags) live in its
`port.h` under `PC_PORT`, after the include.

**The runtime and the game adapter** (GAME_CONTRACT.md "4"): the runtime reaches the game only through
`include/psxstack/game.h`, the adapter interface (`game_main`, `game_apply_rate`, the `game_state_*` probes and
checkpoint image, `game_state_read`/`game_state_host` for PS1 addresses outside the arena, `game_mods`), implemented
in the game's adapter with a weak default for each in `runtime/game_defaults.c`. The runtime's game facts come from
`psxstack_game_gen.h`, generated at configure time from the game's `game.json` (`tools/game_gen.py`):
`PSXSTACK_GAME_ID`/`_TITLE`/`_ENV_PREFIX`/`_RATE`, `PORT_SLOT_COUNT` and `PORT_SLOT<n>_BASE/SIZE/NAME/OFS`, the heap,
the accepted discs (`PSXSTACK_GAME_DISCS`) and the BIOS stand-ins. The brand strings (`--version`, the window title,
the crash report's header, the cache directory `<id>-port`, the disc error) and the environment variables
(`<PREFIX>_PORT_TRACE`, `_FAST_FORWARD`, `_CHECKPOINT_DIR`, `_RESET_CHECK`, `_CRASH_AT`, `_PRESENT_READBACK`,
`_GPU_VRAM_CHECK`, `_PRIM_DUMP`, `_SUBPIXEL_LOG`) read them.

## Memory arena
One static block, `port_arena`, stands for the PS1 RAM from the first slot up (`runtime/arena.c`; the sizes are the
description's, generated into `psxstack_game_gen.h`: the slots in address order, contiguous, then the heap,
`memory.heap.host_size` large). The first game's layout, as an example:

| Region | PS1 address | Size | Macro (on `port_arena`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slot 1 (the stage overlays) | `0x80082CB0` | `0x23130` | `port_slot1` |
| Slot 2 (the map files) | `0x800A5DE0` | `0x5A20` | `port_slot2` |
| Heap | `0x800AB800` | 4 MB (the PS1's is 1.3 MB; 64-bit runtime structs are larger) | `port_heap_start`, `port_heap_end` |

- The regions are macros on `port_arena + offset`, so their addresses stay constant expressions (a game's static initializers
  use them). A pointer's PS1-style address is `PORT_SLOT1_BASE + offset`
  (`port_ptr_to_s32`); an ordering-table tag is an offset in the tag window (`port_ptr_to_u32`, below).
- **No alignment or link address is assumed:** the block is 4 KB-aligned, the arena would work in a PIE (the ELF
  link stays non-PIE for the ld script's sake, "Compiling the game C for the host"), and nothing
  relies on the arena lying below 4 GB. This is what a PE (Windows) build needs: COFF allows no section alignment past 8 KB and ASLR moves
  the image.
- Everything a game's heap hands out (objects, packet buffers, ordering tables, the file cache) lives in the heap
  region, so most primitives and ordering tables are in the arena; a few may be static (the first game's battle
  cursor OT, in an overlay's `.bss`), which is why tags are offsets in the **tag window**, not in the arena.
- **The tag window** (`port_tag_base`, `port_tag_span`; `port_overlay_init` measures it, `arena.c` keeps it): the
  lowest to the highest address of the units' `.data`/`.bss` regions and the arena, i.e. one image's writable memory,
  a few MB (more in a sanitizer build, with ASan's redzone after each of the game's globals). A tag is a word
  offset in it, so it may span up to 64 MB (a startup check).
- The slot buffers hold data files loaded into a slot (files without code) and the targets of
  `SLOT_PTR`; code overlays are linked in, not copied (see "Overlays").

## Ordering tables on 64-bit
- PS1 primitives start with a tag whose address field is 24 bits (`P_TAG.addr`). A game sets it through
  `setaddr`/`addPrim` and may compare `ptr & 0xFFFFFF` with tags; `ClearOTagR` terminates with `0xFFFFFF`.
- On the host `PTR_TO_U32(p)` is the pointer's **word offset** in the tag window (`port_ptr_to_u32`; a fatal error
  for a pointer outside it or not word-aligned), so a tag's low 24 bits are that offset and this code works unchanged:
  the game only stores tags, passes them on (`addPrim`: `setaddr(p, getaddr(ot))`, where the macro keeps an integer
  argument as it is, chosen at compile time by the argument's type) and compares them; only the shim resolves one. `DrawOTag`/`ContinueDraw` follow a link as `port_tag_base + 4 * (tag & 0xFFFFFF)`, inside the tag
  window. A test harness that keeps PS1 lists as they are can give the shim a byte-offset window instead
  (`psyq_set_arena`), with its own `port_ptr_to_u32`.
- Primitive layouts therefore stay PS1-sized; no primitive type is widened.

## 64-bit layout
- **Runtime structs grow** on 64-bit (any struct holding a pointer). Code that hard-coded a PS1 size now uses
  `sizeof`: object allocations, heap allocations and `bzero`s. The literal sizes left are true byte counts, each
  marked `PC_PORT:` (`tools/port_inventory.py counts` lists them; `object-sizes` keeps the object data blocks from
  regressing).
- **Disc formats are unaffected** when the structs that describe disc data are pointer-free or are compiled from C,
  so they re-lay themselves out.
- **Save data is pointer-free** in a game the port is meant for (the first game's save slot is the pointer-free
  prefix of its state): cards written by the port and by the PS1 (or an emulator) are then byte-compatible.
- **The `-m32` build is the layout oracle:** pointers are 4 bytes there, as on the PS1, and the per-frame log holds no
  host address, so a run whose log differs between `-m32` and `-m64` has a pointer-size bug on one side.
  The first game's `tools/port_inventory.py structs` compares struct sizes at both widths with the documented PS1 sizes.

## Overlays
Every overlay is **linked statically** into the binary (a game's naming convention must leave no duplicate global
across overlays: `tools/port_inventory.py link` checks). The overlay manager (`runtime/overlay.c`) stands in for the
PS1's copy into the slot:

- **Data reset:** on the PS1 every load also resets the overlay's `.data`/`.bss`, because the file contains them.
  Each unit is compiled through `port_gen.py rename` (CMake's compiler launcher), which puts the object's
  `.data`/`.bss` sections into its overlay's (ELF: GNU objcopy renames them after the compile; PE: the overlay's
  `#pragma clang section` forced into the compile, since objcopy breaks COFF COMDATs and with them the unwind
  tables, `docs/RUNTIME.md`): on ELF `<id>_data_<ovl>`/`<id>_bss_<ovl>`, orphan
  output sections whose `__start_`/`__stop_` symbols GNU ld makes by itself; on PE the chunk groups
  `.psxdata$<ovl>_1`/`.psxbss$<ovl>_1` of the `.psxdata`/`.psxbss` sections, which lld sorts by their `$` suffix
  between generated empty marker chunks (`_0`, `_2`) carrying the same symbols (`port_gen.py markers`). No linker
  script (DECISIONS "Overlay sections by renaming, no linker script"). The manager snapshots the ranges at startup
  and restores them when `OVERLAY_COPY` loads a file, under the same "a different stage/file" condition the game
  checks. A post-link check (`port_gen.py sections`) fails the build if a writable section of a game object was
  not renamed.
- **Current overlay per tier:** a code file becomes its tier's current overlay; a data file (no table) is copied into
  the slot buffer, exactly as the PS1's `memcpy` would.
- **Address tables:** generated after compilation from each overlay's symbol file (`overlays.txt` names them),
  keeping each function that `nm` finds as a global. The generator checks every tag site in the C (`SLOT_FUNC` and
  `LATE_FUNC` sites it finds itself, against every table of their tier; the sites whose overlay the game knows, from
  its `tag_sites.txt`, against that overlay) and fails the build on one that does not resolve. At run time `port_overlay_resolve` looks a tag up in its tier's current overlay; a tag the current
  overlay does not define is fatal.
- **Copy time:** the PS1's byte-loop `memcpy` takes measurable time (0x19000 bytes are about 1.8 frames),
  and the emulator's checkpoints can observe the state in between. The manager runs `size * 12 / 677376` vsync
  ticks after a copy to keep that order.
- A file listed as an overlay without a symbol file is data only; it is loaded raw into the slot.

## Interrupts, the pump and timing
- The port is **single-threaded and deterministic**. A frame is one vsync tick, run from the game's `VSync()`, from
  `PLATFORM_WAIT()` (`port_wait`), or from LIBCD's `StGetNext` once per 5000 empty polls (the movie player spins with
  no wait hook).
- Each tick renders the vsync's audio, runs the game's vsync callback (frame counters, play time, the display flip,
  LIBSND's sequencer tick), then `port_frame` (`runtime/pump.c`): the CD tick, the frame log, the window's input or
  the script's step, screenshots and the window's present.
- **CD timing** is modelled in vsync ticks (`--cd-speed realistic`: 3 sectors per tick at double speed after a seek;
  `instant`: no seek, up to 75 per tick).
- **Real time** applies only with a window: vsyncs are paced to the nominal rate against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. Pacing
  changes only the time between vsyncs, so a window run's log and record equal the headless run's.
- **Frame rate:** the description's `video.rate` (50 PAL, 60 NTSC). `--refresh N` (one of the description's `rates`)
  sets the pace, audio and CD rates to match and calls the adapter's `game_apply_rate(N)` for the game's own response
  (the first game's NTSC-patch mode).
- **Watchdog:** `--watchdog SEC` exits when no `port_wait()` ran for that long (a loop no hook reaches).
- **Pause:** the pump can hold the game between two vsyncs (the window's pause key; the debug channel's pause, step
  and wait). Nothing of it reaches the game, the log or the record.
- **Debug channel** (`--debug SOCKET`): a tool drives the running game between two vsyncs (below).
- **Console reset** (`runtime/reset.c`): a script's `reset` step longjmps from the vsync tick back to `main()`,
  restores every game section from the startup snapshot, zeroes the arena and resets the shim, then runs the game's
  `main()` again. `<PREFIX>_PORT_RESET_CHECK=1` verifies the restore.
- **Save states** (`runtime/savestate.c`, "Save states" below): the end of a vsync saved to a file, and a later run
  going on from it.

## Debug channel and the MCP server
`--debug SOCKET` (`runtime/debug.c`, whose header comment is the protocol, v1) opens a Unix stream socket of
newline-delimited JSON requests (`{"id", "op", ...}`), answered in order, on which a tool drives and inspects the
running game, headless or in a window. Without the option nothing of it exists (`port_frame` pays one branch): the
bare binary, the replays and the goldens are unchanged. The ops:
- `status`: frame, stage, file, map, paused, pace, pad owner. `pause` / `resume`: hold the game at the next vsync
  boundary (the pump's pause, shared with the window's pause key). `step frames`: exactly N vsyncs, then pause.
- `wait`: run until a host or PS1 read, the stage or the map equals a value, or a timeout in frames; leaves the game
  paused. `pad buttons frames release [sync]`: the channel owns pad 1 (`psyq_pad_set` each vsync) until `pad_free`;
  a script keeps precedence.
- `peek` / `poke`: raw host memory, any range `/proc/self/maps` says is mapped (a bad address never faults the game).
  `peek_ps1` / `poke_ps1`: a PS1 address, the arena (from the first slot's base) directly at any length, anything
  else through the adapter's state map (`game_state_read`, 1/2/4 bytes).
- `screenshot path` (the display image as a binary PPM), `hash` (the game-state image, as a checkpoint hashes it), `pace fps`, `reset` (the console reset, after the answer), `quit status`.
- `save_state path`: the whole state at the end of the current vsync (at once when paused, else at this vsync's
  end). `load_state path`: checked and answered, then the game goes on from it (through `main`, as the reset); a game
  that was paused is paused again at the loaded vsync ("Save states").

The game thread polls the socket itself: once per vsync from `port_frame` (after the script's step, before the video)
and 50 times a second while the pump holds it paused. So every command runs between two vsyncs, reads and writes are
frame-consistent, and a driven run is as deterministic as a scripted one (the same presses at the same frames give the
same log and record). A deferred op (`step`, `wait`, `pad` with sync) is answered when it completes, and nothing else is
read meanwhile. `--debug` turns the watchdog and the default frame cap off; a client that disconnects frees the pad and
resumes the game. `--debug-hold` holds the game paused at its first vsync until the client resumes it, so a run is
reproducible from frame 1 (without it an unthrottled headless game is past the boot by the time the client connects).

`tools/mcp/` (`tools/mcp/README.md`) is the MCP server on top of it, registered for Claude Code by the game's
`.mcp.json`, which passes the configuration on the command line (the root, the game description, the binaries, the
symbol files, the disc): `game.py` is the plain client (no MCP dependency; `Game.spawn`, one method per op),
`symbols.py` adds names (host addresses from `nm` on the ELF, PS1 addresses from the game's symbol files:
`mem_read("ps1:gamestate_data+8")`), `server.py` the tools (`game_start`, `pad_press`, `wait_stage`, `mem_read`,
`screenshot` as a PNG image, `state_hash`, ...). `fake_game.py` is the protocol double for `selftest.py`, which runs
with fixture symbol files and no game.

## Save states
A state is the whole machine at the end of a vsync; a later run of the same binary goes on from it
(`--save-state WHEN:FILE`, `--load-state FILE`, the debug channel's `save_state`/`load_state`; the options and the file
format are in docs/RUNTIME.md "Save states"). An emulator saves its emulated CPU; here the game is native code, so the
state is the game's memory plus its own C stack and registers, and the design is about making those portable to
another process:
- **The game on a stack of its own.** At a vsync the game is deep in its call chain (its main loop, a `VSync` or a
  `PLATFORM_WAIT`, `psyq_vsync_tick`, `port_frame`), and those frames hold return addresses, frame pointers and
  pointers to its globals, the arena and the stack itself. When states may be used (a state option, `--debug`) the
  game runs on a static 8 MB array of `savestate.c` (a three-instruction stack switch per architecture: x86-64 SysV and
  Win64, i386, AArch64), so the stack's address is fixed with the image.
- **Fixed addresses.** Everything a state holds points into the image: code (return addresses, the function pointers in
  the game's objects, the callbacks the shim keeps), the game's sections, the arena, the shim's statics, the game
  stack. ELF builds are linked non-PIE, so every run of a binary has the same addresses; the header names the binary
  (its SHA-1) and the addresses, and a load checks them. The heap is never in a state: the one heap buffer the
  game-visible state reaches, the memory cards' images, is media, like the disc.
- **The context.** `port_frame` ends with `PORT_SAVESTATE_POINT()`: `__builtin_setjmp` keeps the frame and stack
  pointers and the resume address (glibc's `jmp_buf` is mangled with a per-process key, so not `setjmp`), and the
  function saves every callee-saved register in its own frame; the stack above that point and that buffer are the
  context. A load writes the stack back from `main`'s stack and `__builtin_longjmp`s into it: `port_frame` returns into
  the saved vsync. A stack protector's canary (glibc on x86: the thread pointer's word) is the saving process's, so
  the loader sets it before the jump; AddressSanitizer is told about the stack as a fiber, and its fake stacks (frames
  on the heap) must be off.
- **The modules.** Each module with state the game can observe has one sync function at the end of its file
  (`savestate.h`): the game's sections (overlay.c), the arena, every library of the shim (`psyq_state`: LIBCD's drive,
  sector, stream ring and XA decoder, the VRAM and the drawing state, the GTE, LIBSND, ...), the SPU, the audio's vsync
  count, the run's record and the script's progress, and the adapter's (`game_savestate`: its mods). The same function
  saves and loads, in one order. Host state stays the loading run's: the window, the audio device, files, options,
  the debug channel, and the caches that are rebuilt: gpu.c's decoded textures are stamped stale, the GTE's sub-pixel
  shadow starts empty (as at the reset), the hardware renderer gets the power-on event and reloads its VRAM from the
  software VRAM (a state loaded at an internal scale
  above 1 starts from the 1x VRAM: what was drawn before the save is upscaled until redrawn).
- **What is proved** (the first game's `tests/port/savestate.py`): a run resumed from its first battle's state ends
  with the straight run's record, the straight log's lines after the saved frame and the same audio, in the `-m64`,
  `-m32` and sanitizer builds and the Windows build under Wine; the debug channel's save, step, load, step gives the
  same game state and picture.

## The Psy-Q shim
`psyq/` implements the Psy-Q functions its games call (the first game: 123; `tools/port_inventory.py counts` lists
a game's; `psyq/check.sh --game-root DIR` checks that each, and the SDK data symbols the C uses, is defined) against
the prototypes in the game's recovered `psyq/*.h` headers (DECISIONS "Psy-Q headers: the game's, for now"). It is
our own code, MIT, written from the games' use of the API and public hardware documentation (psx-spx). The
libraries' internals (`_spu_*`, `_card_*`, ...) are never needed: only what a game calls. A function a new game needs
and the shim lacks stops the run with `port_unimplemented(name)` (status 3) and is added to the shim.

| Library | In the shim |
|---|---|
| LIBGPU | Real; drives the software GPU (`libgpu.c`, `gpu.c`) |
| LIBGTE | Real, on the software GTE (`libgte.c`, `gte.c`) |
| LIBGS | TIM info, the GTE set-up, the world-screen and light matrices (`libgs.c`); `GsInitGraph`/`GsInit3D` do the PS1's GTE and matrix set-up and skip its draw environments |
| LIBETC | `VSync`, `VSyncCallback`, `SetVideoMode`, `ResetCallback`: real, on the pump |
| LIBCD | A real command model over the disc image, timed in ticks; interrupt-driven sector reads, streaming (`St*`, `CdRead2`); XA sectors to the XA decoder (`libcd.c`, `xa.c`) |
| LIBPRESS | MDEC movie decoding (`libpress.c`, `mdec.c`) |
| LIBSND | The sequencer and voices over the SPU core (`libsnd*.c`; `docs/SOUND.md` in the first game) |
| LIBPAD | A digital pad on port 0; actuator calls accepted and ignored |

`<PREFIX>_PORT_TRACE=1` traces every shim call. The behaviours each library still assumes (rather than checked
against the PS1 or an emulator) are listed in `psyq/README.md` "Behaviour assumed".

## Rendering
- **Software GPU** (`psyq/gpu.c`): a 1024x512 VRAM of 16-bit pixels and every GP0 drawing command the primitive types produce: flat/Gouraud/textured polygons with 4/8/15-bit textures and CLUTs, texture windows,
  the four blend modes, dithering, mask bits, lines, rectangles, fills, VRAM copies and transfers, the draw area and
  offset. Exact VRAM semantics matter: games reuse VRAM (`MoveImage`, `DR_MOVE` cursors with `BreakDraw`/`ContinueDraw`). It is built at `-O3` in every build.
- **Video output** (`runtime/video.c`): every vsync the display area set by `PutDispEnv` is read from the VRAM in 15-
  or 24-bit mode (movies and the title are 24-bit; 320x480 interlaced frames are shown whole) and converted to 32-bit
  pixels. `--screenshot` writes it as a PPM in any build.
- **Window** (SDL3, static, pinned in `scripts/setup.sh`): the image at 4:3, nearest-neighbour, integer-scaled;
  fullscreen toggle. SDL selects X11/Wayland and the audio backend at run time.
- **Hardware renderer** (`runtime/render_gpu.c`; the first game's DECISIONS "The hardware renderer"): SDL_GPU on Vulkan,
  on Windows on Direct3D 12 first (SDL's order; `SDL_GPU_DRIVER=vulkan` picks Vulkan there), only in the SDL build,
  chosen by `--renderer gpu` or `video.renderer` (default `software`). Its shaders (`shaders/*.hlsl`) are compiled to
  SPIR-V at build time by the pinned DXC (`scripts/setup.sh dxc`), for Windows also to DXIL, signed by DXC's
  `libdxil.so` on the Linux host (`cmake/embed.cmake` refuses an unsigned one), and embedded in the binary; the device
  says which it takes (`SDL_GetGPUShaderFormats`, `runtime/render_gpu_shaders.h`). Under Wine the D3D12 pictures are
  the Vulkan build's byte for byte (Wine's vkd3d and vkd3d-proton; the first game's issue #67); Wine's own vkd3d
  refuses SDL's swapchain parameters, so the window there presents with vsync. It presents into the window's swapchain with an integer nearest mapping into video.c's 4:3 rectangle
  (the software image through it is SDL_Renderer's output, pixel for pixel); when no device can present (no Vulkan
  driver; NVIDIA on SDL's offscreen driver) the run logs why and uses SDL_Renderer.
  `--gpu-screenshot FRAME[@WxH]:PATH` writes its picture (headless too). Its rasteriser draws the software GPU's
  decoded command stream (gpu.c's listener: every triangle, rectangle, line segment, fill, copy and transfer) into a
  VRAM target of its own, and a 15-bit display is presented from it (24-bit displays stay the software image). Its
  pixel shader is gpu.c's pixel pipeline in integers (attributes from gpu.c's plane equations, coverage by the GPU);
  blending, dithering and the mask test read a copy of the target refreshed per triangle or segment where something was
  drawn since (no fixed-function blending); texels come from a copy of the software VRAM uploaded in stream order from
  gpu.c's write stamps; an overlapping copy that smears takes its result from the VRAM.
  - **Internal scale 1** (the default): the target equals the software VRAM, so the picture is the software path's
    (the first game's gpu golden family and its replays, whole VRAM, NVIDIA and lavapipe).
  - **Internal scale 2 to 8** (`--internal-scale N`, `video.internal_scale`, the launcher's Resolution slider): the
    target is 1024N x 512N, each VRAM pixel N x N target pixels. Triangles are drawn at that resolution (a target pixel
    samples coverage at its top-left corner, so straight edges on whole coordinates meet rectangles on block
    boundaries; attributes are gpu.c's plane equations at the pixel's place, exact in 32-bit integers, texture
    coordinates and colours kept within the vertices' range), without dithering, in 8-bit colour; rectangles, sprites,
    lines, fills and transfers are N x N blocks. Texels still come from the 1x VRAM copy, so render-to-texture effects
    keep 1x texels. The display is presented at that resolution, nearest when the window is at least as large, averaged
    over N x N blocks when it is smaller (supersampling). The target and its background copy take 8 MB times N squared
    (256 MB at 8); a device that cannot allocate them gets a lower scale (logged). The game's own cost is unchanged.
  - The software GPU stays the reference and the default; every existing test uses it.

## Texture replacement
`runtime/render_gpu_textures.c` (the first game's issue #70; its research comment has the measurements). Only in the
SDL build, and nothing of it runs unless it is switched on.
- **The key** names what a textured primitive samples by what the game loaded, not by where it landed: games move one
  image around the VRAM and reuse a place for many images. It is the SHA-1 (first 8 bytes) of the CPU-to-VRAM transfer
  the texels came from, taken when the transfer finished, with the transfer's size; the SHA-1 of the 16 or 256 CLUT
  entries the primitive reads, taken at the draw (CLUT rows come from transfers of many rows and from reused slots);
  and the depth (4, 8 or 15: one transfer may hold images of two depths).
- **Which transfer** comes from an owner map: each VRAM word holds the transfer that wrote it, every other write (a
  draw's bounding box in its drawing area, a fill, a copy) clears its words, and a primitive has a key only when all
  the words under its texel rectangle are one transfer's. Per word because games load small images into part of an
  earlier page and keep drawing from the rest. Render-to-texture and copies have no key: they keep the VRAM's texels.
  16x16 tiles record whether they hold transfer words, so drawing into the display buffer costs a check per tile.
- **The dump** (`--dump-textures DIR`, docs/RUNTIME.md "Texture dump") writes each key the first time a primitive
  samples it. The first game's new_game replay has 134 keys, first_battle_save 1,728 (18 MB of PNGs; its run takes
  26 s instead of 17 s with the dump on). The game's log and record are unchanged by it.
- **Packs** (`runtime/render_gpu_packs.c`, `--texture-pack DIR`, docs/RUNTIME.md "Texture packs") are data mods whose
  PNGs are named by key. The rasteriser looks a textured triangle's or rectangle's key up when it records the unit
  (before the unit's own writes change the owner map); a unit with a replacement binds it in the pixel shader's third
  texture slot and samples it instead of the VRAM (`F_REPLACED` in `shaders/raster.frag.hlsl`): at the sample point's
  texture coordinates (gpu.c's integers at internal scale 1, the planes' exact values above it) mapped onto the
  replacement's rectangle, filtered, before any discard (the mipmap level needs defined derivatives). Its alpha decides
  transparency and bit 15; modulation, blending, dithering and the mask then run as for a VRAM texel. At internal scale 1
  a texel's colour is rounded back to 5 bits, so a pack made of the unedited dump keeps the target equal to the
  software VRAM (the first game's replays, every 10 vsyncs).

## GTE
`psyq/gte.c` is the geometry coprocessor in software: the 64 registers with their read/write rules, every
command (RTPS/RTPT with the UNR division, NCLIP, MVMVA, the lighting and depth-cue commands, AVSZ3/4, GPF/GPL, ...),
FLAG and the saturations, in the PS1's fixed point. A game's GTE code reaches it through the generated `gtemac.h`; LIBGTE's functions call it too.

## Sub-pixel precision
The GTE gives a game whole-pixel screen coordinates: RTPS keeps the top half of a 16.16 sum. At internal scale N
the hardware renderer would draw the 3D at those 1x positions, and a slowly moving vertex would jump a whole 1x pixel
(N target pixels) at a time. `psyq/gte_shadow.c` keeps what the GTE cut away and finds it again when the polygon is
drawn, without changing anything the game reads: the command stream, the software picture and the frame hash are the
same with it on or off.
- **The value:** the 16.16 sum itself (gte.c's `OFX + IR * (H / SZ)`), in a FIFO beside SXY0-2, with the vertex's
  SZ. Its floor is the integer by construction; a clamped value has none. A float re-projection would not agree with
  the integer at the boundaries.
- **Following it:** games store SXY into a vertex cache with `swc2` and copy the words into packets in plain C,
  which the shim cannot see (an emulator's PGXP can: it watches every memory access). The shim sees two things:
  every `swc2` of SXY (the generated `gtemac.h` calls `psyq_gte_swc2_`) with its address, and every primitive when it
  is linked into an ordering table, complete (`addPrim`'s `setaddr` goes through `port_ptr_to_u32`). A run of SXY
  stores to consecutive words is a *batch* (one mesh's vertex cache); a linked polygon whose vertex words are all in
  the current batch gets, for each vertex word's host address, the batch's value for that word. A word two vertices of
  the batch share with different fractions (about 5 % of the first game's battle vertices) gets their mean: still a
  function of the word, so a vertex shared by several faces lands at the same place in each. A polygon with a word not
  in the batch (a 2D primitive) has its addresses cleared. A direct `swc2` into a packet is found by its address too.
- **Using it:** gpu.c notes the host address each word of a DMA'd primitive came from and, for a polygon vertex, asks
  the shadow (`psyq_gte_shadow_find`); a value counts only when its word is the word read and its integer part the
  integer drawn. The listener's `GpuVertex` then carries the fraction (`fx`, `fy`, 1/65536 pixel; -1 without) and SZ.
  Entries live in two tables swapped every 4 vsyncs, so none outlives the packet buffers it described.
- **Off by default:** `psyq_gte_shadow_enable` turns it on; off it costs a branch per RTPS vertex, per drawn polygon
  vertex and per linked primitive. On, in the first game's battle, 98 % of the drawn polygon vertices find their value
  (the rest are clamped ones and 2D), and the cost is within the run-to-run noise of a headless run.
- **Drawing** (`runtime/render_gpu_subpixel.c`; `--subpixel on|off`, `video.subpixel`, default on): above internal
  scale 1 the hardware renderer places a vertex with a value at `x + fx / 65536 - 1/2` (the half pixel centres it on
  the integer, whose floor it is, so vertices without one, 2D among them, stay where they were) and its attributes
  come from float planes through the precise vertices (`raster.frag.hlsl` `F_PRECISE`), sampled where the integer
  path samples them and rounded as it rounds. At scale 1 nothing changes: the shadow is not even on. The renderer
  turns the shadow on and off with the rasteriser.
- **Measuring:** `<PREFIX>_PORT_SUBPIXEL_LOG=path` turns it on from boot and logs every RTPS vertex, the batches and
  each frame's drawn-vertex counts (`_FROM`, `_TO`: a frame range); the format is in `gte_shadow.c`'s header. The first
  game's `tests/port/subpixel_jitter.py` turns it into the jitter metric.

## Input
- **Window input** (`runtime/input.c`): the keyboard and every gamepad SDL sees are ORed into pad 1, a digital pad,
  once per vsync. Bindings are by key position and SDL's positional (PlayStation-layout) gamepad buttons, rebindable
  in the settings file; hotkeys (fullscreen, pause, the mods') never reach the pad. The mapping and defaults are in
  `docs/RUNTIME.md` "The window".
- **Scripted input** (`runtime/script.c`): `--script` replays a pad script (the first game's layer-2 format, `docs/RUNTIME.md`)
  with the same step engine as the emulator's runner; the script then owns the pad.
- `--input-test` injects every binding through SDL (keys, a virtual gamepad, chords, hotkeys) and checks what reaches
  the pad.

## Sound
The SPU core (`runtime/spu.c`, `spu_dsp.c`), LIBSND (`psyq/libsnd*.c`), the XA path and the audio output
(`runtime/audio.c`: rendered once per vsync, `--wav`, the SDL3 audio stream with drift correction) are described in
the first game's `docs/SOUND.md`. The audio is a function of the SPU writes and the vsync count, so it is deterministic and identical
with or without an output device.

## Disc, memory cards and movies
- **Disc** (`runtime/disc.c`): the user's BIN/CUE, its SHA-1 checked against the description's `discs` (cached with a
  stamp; `--no-disc-check` skips it; a game with no discs takes no `--disc`). LIBCD reads it at sector level, so a
  game's file table, its 2340-byte read mode and movie streaming work unchanged.
- **Memory cards** (`runtime/memcard.c`, `psyq/libmcrd.c`): raw 128 KB `.mcd` images (the usual emulator
  format), one per slot; every change is written back to the file. A new card is formatted as PCSX-Redux formats
  one. Saves move both ways between the port and the emulator.
- **Movies:** STR files play through the movie stream (`libcd.c`), MDEC decoding (`mdec.c`) and the XA-ADPCM
  decoder (`xa.c`); no FFmpeg.

## Settings and mods
`<game> --config FILE` reads the settings file the launcher writes (disc, window, audio, memory cards, input bindings,
mods); without `--config` the binary depends on nothing on the machine. The mods' engine is `runtime/mods.c`: the
stack's fast_forward and the game's mods (`game_mods`), their manifests (`mods/<id>/mod.json`, the stack's and the
game's directories) copied beside the binary; they are off under `--script` unless `--script-mods`. Formats and
behaviour: `docs/LAUNCHER.md`, `docs/RUNTIME.md` "The settings file" and "The mods".

## Testing
The stack's own tests need no game and no disc (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

| Check | What it proves | Where |
|---|---|---|
| hello | A Psy-Q program builds through `psxstack_add_game()` (the generators, the sections, the shim, the runtime) and draws the same picture everywhere | `tests/hello_test.py` |
| The game description | `game_gen.py` validates and generates; the examples validate | `tests/game_gen_test.py` |
| The launcher | Its headless self-test on Linux, and under Wine from the Windows cross-build | `launcher/README.md` |
| The debug tools | The client, the symbols and the server's tools against the protocol double | `tools/mcp/selftest.py` |

A game brings the oracles: an emulator's goldens replayed through the shim's C, its pad scripts replayed by the port
against the emulator's records, its launcher self-test with the real disc and game (GAME_CONTRACT.md "6"). The first
game's table is in dw2003recomp's `docs/PORT.md` "Testing".

## Crash report

When the game dies of a signal (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGABRT) or stops on a fatal error, a halt, an
unimplemented part or the watchdog, `runtime/crash.c` writes one text file, `crash-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.txt` (UTC), into
`--crash-dir DIR` (the launcher passes `<settings dir>/crashes/`; default: the current directory), and names it on its
last stderr line: `port: crash report: PATH`. The report holds the kind and status, the build (`port_version` and the
commit: `<game> --version`; `cmake/version.cmake` stamps every build from `git describe` over the game's repository), the platform, the vsync
count, the overlays in both tiers, the stage, file and map, the pad, whether a script runs, the last 64 lines of the
port's log, and, for a signal, the signal, the fault address, the pc and sp and the stack; for a fatal stop the reason
and the stack. Code addresses are relative to the executable (`exe+0x...`): the first game's `scripts/symbolize.py REPORT --binary
FILE` names them with `addr2line` against the unstripped build or the release's `.debug` file. The
signal handler is async-signal-safe (a static buffer, `write`), runs on its own stack and is one-shot: after the
report the signal's default action ends the process, so the exit status stays the signal's. The report never enters
the frame log or the record. Test hook: `<PREFIX>_PORT_CRASH_AT=VSYNC` writes through a NULL pointer at that vsync
(`tests/port/crash.py`). A game's CI can keep the reports as an artifact.

**On Windows** the report is the same file. A crash is an unhandled SEH exception (`SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`):
the filter writes the text with `exception:` (the code's name and value, `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005)`),
`fault address:` and `access:` (read, write or execute, for an access violation), `pc:` and `sp:` from the exception's
context, and the stack walked from that context with `RtlVirtualUnwind` over the image's unwind tables (frame 0 is the
faulting instruction, the rest return addresses, through the game's frames to `main`: the units keep their `.pdata`,
"Overlays"). Then a helper thread writes `crash-<stamp>.dmp` beside it with `MiniDumpWriteDump`
(dbghelp.dll, loaded only then; `MiniDumpNormal | MiniDumpWithDataSegs | MiniDumpWithIndirectlyReferencedMemory`: the
threads' stacks and contexts, the module list, the exception record, the image's writable data and what the stacks
point at; a few MB on Windows, 22 KB under Wine, whose dbghelp writes the stacks and the records but ignores the data
flags), the text gets a `minidump:` line, stderr `port: minidump: PATH`, and the process ends with the exception code
as its exit status (what Windows reports for an unhandled exception; the launcher names the codes; `wine` itself
exits with the low byte, 5). `abort()` (and UCRT's invalid-parameter and pure-call handlers, which abort after setting
the reason) writes a report of kind `abort` and exits 3, UCRT's status for abort. The watchdog's thread suspends the
main thread and reports its registers and stack. The `.dmp` opens in WinDbg or Visual Studio with the build's PDB
(`<game>.pdb` beside the exe); llvm-symbolizer (llvm-mingw's) resolves a report's `exe+0x...` addresses with it. A
stack overflow gets the text (the filter runs on what the guard page leaves) and perhaps no dump.

## Known limitations
- **Pads:** one digital pad on port 0; no analog mode, no rumble (`PadSetAct` is accepted and ignored), no second
  port or multitap.
- **No reset key** in the window (the console reset exists only as a script step and a debug-channel op).
- **Timing stand-ins:** the CD seek times (3 ticks + 1 per 8192 sectors, at most 40) and `StGetNext`'s 5000 polls
  per vsync are estimates, not measurements.
- **State probes:** `game_state_read` (a script's `wait_mem`) maps what the game's adapter maps; other pointer-bearing
  objects and overlay data read as unmapped.
- **BIOS:** a stand-in holding the description's texts, not the user's BIOS.
- **Windows** (cross-built from Linux with llvm-mingw, `cmake/windows-x86_64.cmake`; tested under Wine): the runtime's
  operating-system calls are in one file with a POSIX and a Windows half, `runtime/platform.c` (`platform.h`: paths
  with drive letters and `\`, a replacing rename, the per-user cache directory, positional reads of the disc image, a
  monotonic clock and a high-resolution sleep for the pace, the watchdog as a thread); the frame log, the record and
  the SPU trace are written in binary mode (the same bytes on both); stderr is unbuffered on Windows (UCRT has no
  line buffering); the console reset's `setjmp` takes no SEH frame on mingw (`port_setjmp`); `--debug` is refused
  there (the channel is a Unix socket). Save states work under Wine, which loads the image at its preferred base;
  Windows' ASLR may move a PE image between boots, and a state saved at another base is refused. The executable is a GUI-subsystem program (no console window behind it when
  the launcher starts it; stderr still reaches the launcher's pipe) with a manifest (`windows/`: the UTF-8 code page,
  long paths, per-monitor DPI). A crash writes the same report as on Linux plus a minidump ("Crash report"). The SDL
  window is 64-bit only; macOS is not planned.
- **`long` is 32-bit on Windows (LLP64):** the runtime's `long`s are counters and option values (`port_frames`,
  `port_max_frames`, the pace, the step counts), none of which holds a pointer or a byte count over 2 GB; the shim's
  `PSYQ_PTR` and `VSyncCallback` use `uintptr_t`. A game's own `long`s are its to audit; the `-m32` build, where `long`
  is 32-bit too, replaying with the same log as the 64-bit build brackets LLP64 between the two.
- **Sanitizer builds** see other section sizes (ASan's redzones), so logs compare only between builds of the same
  kind.
