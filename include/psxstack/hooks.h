/* psxstack/hooks.h: the host side of the PC port's hook macros and the port_* interface the game's C calls
 * (GAME_CONTRACT.md "2. The hook header"; docs/PORT.md "Hook macros"). The game's include/port.h keeps the PS1 side of
 * every macro (without PC_PORT each expands to the original code) and includes this file under PC_PORT; the runtime
 * includes it through port_runtime.h. The game's constants (the slots, the heap, the brand) come from the generated
 * psxstack_game_gen.h (tools/game_gen.py, from the game's game.json): nothing here names a game.
 *
 * Addresses: the host keeps the PS1's addresses as the *names* of things that live in the overlay slots. A function in
 * a slot is a *tag*: the PS1 address as an integer in a function-pointer variable (SLOT_FUNC), a constant expression
 * for the static tables. A tag is never called directly: OVERLAY_FN turns it into the host function at the call. Data
 * in a slot is slot-relative (SLOT_PTR). `tier` is the slot's 1-based index in game.json's memory.slots. */
